# DiceRollSimulation
Shiny app that simulates dice rolls to demonstrate the law of large numbers. As the number of rolls increases, the average (mean) outcome converges toward the expected value of 3.5, showing how the empirical mean approaches the theoretical mean with larger sample sizes. An interactive tool for visualizing this statistical concept.
